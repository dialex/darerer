# DARERER

**_The app that dares you to be kind, nice or naughty._** _How are you feeling today?_

This was my first adventure in the Android world. Even though the app's concept is quite simple, it allowed me to experiment with numerous concepts relevant for "real" apps:

- Activities, Fragments, and their lifecycles
- Drawables
- Tabbed navigation
- Notifications
- Settings
- Background services
- App Monetization (AdMob)
- App Analytics (Fabric.io)
- Publish to Play Store

There were several :anger: and :sob: moments, more than I expected or desired.<br/>
But at least I finished and learned a lot, so please don't be harsh on my final product :innocent:
